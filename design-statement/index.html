                As an artist and graphic and motion designer, I often find myself imagining how a static project I’m
                working on would look if it were part of a larger motion sequence, or how a frame I come across would
                look as an isolated still graphic.

                How can I create action from a series of beautiful images flowing
                through time?

                Conversely, how can I convey the feeling of suspended time and action in a single frame?

                Many of the compositions and shapes I choose today are made as striking as possible while preserving the
                simplicity of the design. Dynamic angles, bold and erratic lines, and bright colors portray motion in a
                frozen medium.
